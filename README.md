# Using Percentile Detection

-> This project demonstrates how to detect and handle outliers using the percentile-based method. By defining lower and upper percentile thresholds (e.g., 1st and 99th percentile), we can        effectively trim or cap extreme data points, ensuring a cleaner dataset for modeling.

## Key Steps:-
 
-> Compute percentile thresholds using NumPy or pandas.
-> Identify and handle outliers through trimming or capping.
-> Compare data distribution before and after outlier treatment.

## Objective:-
 
-> To understand how percentile-based outlier detection helps in reducing the effect of extreme values and improves the reliability of data analysis.
